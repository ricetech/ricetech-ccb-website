			<p class="rationale1">The Corsair Crystal Series 460X RGB ATX Mid-Tower is one of the leading cases in the new trend of cases that use tempered glass panels to show off the interior components. As the case is the component that holds everything together, it must be designed well, and the Corsair Crystal Series 460X exceeds that criteria. Not only does it have tempered glass, it also has a very well designed interior, which includes rubber grommets to conceal cables passing through to the other side of the case (a must for organization), a modular 3.5” hard drive cage that can be removed if not needed, a good selection of I/O (input/output) on the top such as USB 3.0, audio jacks and lighting controls, very fine dust filters that keep dust out of the well placed air vents, as well as a power supply and hard drive shroud that conceals two of the most cluttered areas of the case. Apart from the amazing interior, the case also comes with three Corsair SP120 RGB fans - the main attraction of the case, apart from the tempered glass. These fans are optimized for static pressure (used when airflow is restricted on either side). Not only do they work well, they also feature RGB to enhance the look of the build. These fans are normally quite expensive, so having fans included is a great benefit. The case also supports liquid cooling, which is used in this build. The Corsair Crystal Series 460X’s large amount of features, stylish looks and very good price made it one of the best cases for this build.</p>

			<p class="pname2">Case Fans</p>
			<p class="des2">Case fans are responsible for moving fresh cool air in and hot air out of the case to keep all of the components cool. They may also be mounted to a heatsink or liquid cooling radiator to assist in heat dissipation. The two most common fan sizes are 120 mm and 140 mm. Anything smaller creates much more noise due to the size of the fan blades, and anything larger usually ends up being too wide to fit in the case. Fan blades are either optimized for airflow (moving as much air as possible) or static pressure (moving air efficiently through areas with restricted airflow). Computers typically exclusively use static pressure fans as all fan mounts in a normal case have an obstruction such as a dust filter, internal component or radiator, which makes airflow optimized fans inefficient.</p>

			<p class="rationale2">Fans are important for maintaining a cool temperature within the computer. Corsair is known for producing very high quality, quiet and efficient fans, leading to the selection of their SP120 RGB static pressure fans for this build. As static pressure fans, they excel in situations where the airflow on either side is restricted by an object - for this build, examples include the radiator of the liquid cooler, the dust filters, and the hard drive cage. While the Corsair Crystal Series 460X comes with 3 SP120 RGB fans included as an intake, it does not include dedicated exhaust fans. Two of the three fans in this pack will be mounted to the NZXT Kraken X52 radiator on the top of the case, as well as one in the rear, with the three acting as an exhaust. At 120 mm, they are a perfect fit for the liquid cooler radiator and the case. While they do not support PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), at 1400 RPM they are quite quiet, yet efficient. These fans also look amazing while working, featuring customizable multi-colour lighting. They can be connected to the controller used by the three included intake fans and sync colours, or they can be connected to the extra included controller to create two zones of lighting. The amazing look and performance of these fans is what gave them a place in this build.</p>

			<p class="rationale3">The PSU (Power Supply Unit) is an extremely important part to the build, so no compromises could be made when selecting one for this build. SeaSonic is such a reliable manufacturer that other companies buy their designs to sell under their own name. The SeaSonic G-550W 80+ Gold Semi-Modular ATX PSU, while simple, fits this build very well. At load, this computer consumes up to 425 W. Using a 550 W power supply allows for a good buffer of extra power in case of component malfunction. The 80+ Gold certification ensures maximum efficiency compared to non-rated or Bronze and Silver rated PSUs. This wattage does not require the extremely high, but expensive efficiency of a 80+ Titanium PSU. This PSU also features a fan that turns off when not needed, making the computer run quieter. The simple black colour allows it to fit into the build, and the semi-modularity means that only the necessary cables are plugged into the PSU, reducing cable clutter. The simplicity, yet high reliability of the Seasonic G-550W 80+ Gold Semi-Modular ATX PSU are the reason why it has a place in this build.</p>
