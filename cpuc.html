			<p class="rationale1">The AMD Ryzen series of processors is AMD's new flagship line of desktop processors. Ryzen processors provide high levels of performance at an extremely competitive cost. The high performance Ryzen 7 series is joined by the mid-range Ryzen 5, and later in the year, the Ryzen 3 series. The Ryzen 7 series is designed to compete with Intel's enthusiast Broadwell-E platform and their consumer Skylake/Kaby Lake platforms. The AMD Ryzen 7 1700 provides a similar level of performance to the Broadwell-E intel Core i7-6800K for almost $200 less. Featuring 8 cores and 16 threads, the Ryzen 7 1700 features 2 more cores and 4 more threads than the i7-6800K while consuming 75W less power, with a TDP &#40;Thermal Design Power&#41; of just 65W even with similar clock speeds and cache size to the i7-6800K. The extra cores, which have very good multi-core performance, make it a great choice for gaming as well as high-intensity multi-core tasks such as video editing as well. It is also easily overclockable, easily reaching 4 GHz without becoming unstable. It also supports a new chipset layout that allows more devices &#40;namely PCIe, USB, and M.2&#41; to be connected directly to the processor instead of going through a chipset. The amazing price to performance ratio compared to Intel's offerings made this new processor a very good addition to the build.</p>

			<p class="pname2">CPU Cooler</p>
			<p class="des2">Responsible for keeping the CPU's temperature as low as possible to prevent damage from overheating. To do this, heat can either be dissipated through copper pipes and a heatsink &#40;known as air cooling&#41;, or using cooling liquid running in tubes between a block attached to the CPU and a radiator mounted to the case &#40;known as liquid or water cooling&#41;.</p>

			<p class="rationale2">While the AMD Ryzen 7 1700 does include a rather nice looking RGB &#40;Red/Green/Blue Multicolour Lighting&#41; equipped Wraith cooler, the cooler simply cannot handle the heat generated when overclocking without sounding like a jet engine. This is where the NZXT Kraken X52 All-in-one closed loop liquid cooler comes in. As it is an All-in-one cooler (which means that it includes a pump, radiator and reservoir in one unit, saving money), it is much less expensive than a full custom liquid cooling setup. It is NZXT's newest offering, released with the larger Kraken X62 cooler in the winter of 2016. The cooler is one of the best available, cooling the processor more efficiently than nearly every other all-in-one cooler on the market. It comes with Aer P120 fans on the radiator, however to match the build, the fans were replaced by Corsair SP120 RGB &#40;Red/Green/Blue Multicolour Lighting&#41; fans in a push &#40;instead of pull&#41; configuration to avoid dust build up and to conserve space within the computer compared to a push-pull configuration. The CPU block itself is RGB illuminated with a very interesting infinity mirror effect, allowing it to become any colour, just like the rest of the build. The radiator, mounted to the top of the case, will also serve as one of the two exhaust outlets for the system. The best in class performance from a reputable brand such as NZXT, along with the unique cooler block cemented its place in this build.</p>
