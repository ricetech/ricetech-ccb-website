			<p class="rationale">With the recent release of the nVidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU (Graphics Processing Unit, also known as a graphics card), the GTX 1080 has dropped in price. As the budget for this build does not allow for a 1080 Ti, I decided to go with a GTX 1080 for this build. The ROG STRIX 1080 8G from ASUS goes with my choice for the motherboard of this build. As they are from the same company, many features of the card, such as the amazing RGB lighting and fan control are handled by the same software, allowing the motherboard and graphics card to light up in sync. As their flagship card, the ROG STRIX GTX 1080 8G, aside from a very attractive lighting system, features the ASUS DirectCU III cooler with 3 fans and an oversized heatsink for extra cooling capability, as well as a modest factory overclock applied to the GPU, although the clock speed can be pushed to 2 GHz/2000 MHz with a little bit of tweaking. ASUS is also rather well known for their good fan control curves, not allowing the fans to get too loud when they are not needed. The GTX 1080 itself features an extremely large (nearly 2X) performance boost over its predecessor, the GTX 980. It also has 8GB of GDDR5X (Double Data Rate Synchronous Graphics RAM) video memory, preventing out-of-memory errors and crashes caused by games that load extremely large amounts of scenery at once. One of the more unique features of the ROG STRIX model is the inclusion of two case fan headers directly on the GPU. As ASUS puts it on their website, 
			"When gaming, GPU temperatures are often higher than CPU temps. However, chassis fans usually reference CPU temperatures only, which results in inefficient cooling of the system."
			The ASUS ROG STRIX GTX 1080 8G graphics card, with its reliability just like everything else from ASUS, synchronized lighting system, amazing DirectCU III cooler, very good value, large amount of VRAM (Video Random Access Memory), and high clock speed make it very hard to beat in terms of quality, which is why I chose it for this build.</p>
