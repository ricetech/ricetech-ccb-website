		<section class="intro" id="intro">
			<p class="introt">Welcome to the showcase website of the RiceTech Custom Build 3X. This high-end build has very few compromises in its design. It's centered around RGB multicoloured components that can be lit up in any colour to fit the mood and ambiance of the day. It uses the latest components while also keeping with the newest trends, including but not limited to RGB and tempered glass. This build is centered around gaming and content creation, however that does not limit the computer's purpose. With the power that it has, it can also accomplish just about anything else while still looking amazing.</p>
