			<p class="rationale1">ASUS has always been known for producing extremely high quality motherboards, and this one is no exception. The Crosshair VI Hero is a standard ATX &#40;Advanced Technology eXtended&#41; sized board with all of the features expected from a reliable company such as ASUS. It features an extremely high quality sound card along with a DAC &#40;digital to analog converter&#41; built into the board, several fan headers specially designated for water coolers, their extremely well-known UEFI BIOS &#40;Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Basic Input Output System&#41;, their also extremely well-known CPU power delivery system, several ASUS exclusive builder-friendly features such as Q-connectors, Q-PCIe slots and Q-DIMM &#40;Dual Inline Memory Module&#41; slots, ASUS Aura RGB board lighting along with several RGB LED &#40;Light Emitting Diode&#41; strip headers, and all of the latest connectivity, such as USB &#40;Universal Serial Bus&#41; 3.1 Gen2, M.2 SSDs and WiFi Cards, 2 PCIe 3.0 x16 &#40;Peripheral Component Interconnect Express Generation 3&#41; slots to allow for a future installation of a second graphics card in nVidia SLI &#40;Scalable Link Interface&#41;, Intel Gigabit LAN &#40;Local Area Network&#41;, and an extremely large number of USB 2.0/3.0 ports. The proven reliability and large number of features for the price make this motherboard a very good choice for the build.</p>

			<p class="pname2">RAM &#40;Random Access Memory&#41;</p>
			<p class="des2">Short-term memory for storing open programs and files in use by the computer. Attaches to the motherboard. Data is lost if power is lost. Much faster than a hard drive, but slower than the CPU cache. The current standard is DDR4 &#40;Double Data Rate 4th Generation&#41;. Average capacity today is 16GB. Typically found in dual or quad channel &#40;2 or 4&#41; configurations.</p>

			<p class="rationale2">In the market for RAM &#40;Random Access Memory&#41;, Kingston has made a name for themselves as a reliable producer of RAM. I have personally used their HyperX memory in both my own current gaming computer, as well as a friend's gaming computer, and it has proven to be very reliable memory. The choice of a 4x8GB configuration over a 2x16GB configuration for the memory is mostly for aesthetic purposes, as I see filled memory slots as more visually appealing. As the processor only supports Dual Channel and not Quad Channel, there is no performance difference whatsoever between the two configurations. The other reason for using this particular set of memory is due to radiator clearance. The Corsair 460X does not have a lot of clearance near the top if a radiator is installed, requiring the use of low profile memory such as this set to avoid having the radiator or fans strike the memory. This, combined with the reliability of Kingston and the rather sleek black heatsink were the reasons I had for choosing this memory.</p>
