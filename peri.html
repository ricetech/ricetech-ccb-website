			<p class="rationale1">As one of two primary input devices, the keyboard must be able to withstand a lot of typing for many years to come, as it will most likely outlive the computer. The Corsair K70 RGB RAPIDFIRE is a keyboard from the extremely successful K70 gaming keyboard series. As it is from Corsair, it matches the case quite well. This keyboard features one of the newest mechanical keyswitches from the very well known keyswitch company Cherry MX - the MX Speed switches. These switches feature a very short distance required for actuation, resulting in a quicker typing experience. As a derivative of the very popular Cherry MX Red linear switch, it is a very smooth switch that is well suited for gaming, as well as typing. The K70 is also available with Cherry MX Blue and Cherry MX Brown keyswitches for those that prefer typing over gaming. The K70 is known for its build quality, being made from aluminum. It also includes some very useful media keys for controlling the computer. This model also comes with RGB lighting, allowing it to become any colour to match the rest of the computer. The proven quality of the K70 made it an obvious choice.</p>

			<p class="rationale2">While Corsair components make up a fairly sizeable portion of this build, their M65 gaming mouse just cannot compete with the extreme popularity of the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum gaming mouse. This mouse is a re-release of the equally popular Logitech G502 Proteus Core gaming mouse. Both mouses are very similar, however the newer Proteus Spectrum adds RGB lighting to stay with current trends while remaining at the same competitive price. Shared features include weights that can be added or removed into different slots around the mouse to customize the feel of the mouse. There are also 8 customizable buttons in addition to the standard buttons 3 found on a mouse, however even the standard mouse button functions can be edited in the Logitech G software. The scroll wheel is one of the most well known aspects of this mouse, and one of the main reasons for its selection. It switches between the normal, clicky roll, and a free-spinning mode at the touch of a button for effortless scrolling through long lists of items or documents, making it just as useful as a productivity mouse as a gaming mouse. It also features side scrolling. The black colour of the mouse provides a stealth look until the RGB lighting is turned on. The braided USB cable is extremely high quality and very durable. Based on everything listed above, the choice of the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum for this build was very easy. </p>

			<p class="rationale3">The monitor is a very important output for any computer, so a good decision must be made, as the monitor is what the user will be looking at for most of the time. The hp Pavilion 25xw is a very good deal at $159.99. At 25”, it is larger than the average monitor, and using an IPS (in-plane switching) panel, it also looks far better than the average monitor. The 1920 x 1080 resolution is overshadowed by monitors with higher 1440p (2560 x 1440) and 4K (3840 x 2160) resolutions, however not only are both options much more expensive, they also place more pressure on the GPU, as a 4K monitor has four times more pixels, which proves to be a challenge even for a flagship card such as the GTX 1080. 1080p is still the best balance between price and looks, and leaves an option to add in a 1440p or 4K monitor in the future. The hp Pavilion 25xw’s value and amazing IPS panel make it a good monitor for this build.</p>
