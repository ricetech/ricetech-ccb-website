Can be a solid state drive, which are faster and more reliable but cost more, or mechanical, which are slower but cost less. Typical capacities for SSDs: 128/240/256/512/1024/2048/4096GB.

			<p class="rationale1">Computers used to mainly run entirely off of mechanical hard drives. In fact, that is the case with most current laptops. But the new trend for computers is to install a SSD (solid state drive) as the boot drive, with the mechanical hard drive acting as secondary mass data storage. This setup vastly improves loading times for the OS (operating system), software and games and makes the entire computer run extremely quickly. As the prices of storage, including SSDs, continues to drop, this setup has become more and more popular. The Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB is an extremely popular choice among computer builders like myself due to its proven reliability and stability, space efficient V-NAND (Vertical NAND) technology, and its speed, which at 540 MB/s, nearly fully saturates the maximum throughput of a SATA (Serial ATA) 3 port. With this popularity, the Samsung 850 EVO also happens to be one of, if not the best selling consumer SSDs on the market, which is why I chose it for this build.</p>

			<p class="rationale2">While the Samsung 850 EVO is an amazing drive, 250 GB is not enough space to store loads of documents, videos, pictures, music and programs. The Seagate FireCuda 2TB Hybrid Internal Drive is a bit of a different choice for the build. Instead of only using mechanical storage, the Seagate FireCuda line of hybrid drives also have an 8 GB SSD (solid state drive) within the hard drive that intelligently speeds up program and file response times to make working with files much more efficient, giving speeds much faster than a standard mechanical hard drive while still costing far less than a full-fledged SSD. Even though it is a fairly new addition to the market, the Seagate FireCuda 2TB Hybrid Internal Drive is still a very good addition to this build.</p>
